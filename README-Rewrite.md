# The Rewrite

This is Mod is a full Rewrite of the original Immersion Cigs Mod by Rebel & Facel:
- [Immersion Cigs - Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=753946944)
- [Immersion Cigs - Git Hub](https://github.com/rebelvg/immersion_cigs/tree/master)
- [Immersion Cigs - Forum Thread](https://forums.bistudio.com/forums/topic/181841-immersion-cigs/)

> [!WARNING]
> Due to the extensive rewrite, this is not compatible with Mods which have been based/are dependend on the original Mod.

## What is included?

### Full Rewrite of pretty much everything.
- no more scheduled code
  - dependency on CBA
  - Vanilla ScrollWheel Actions are replaced with CBA's Context Menu (Left Click on Inventory Screen)
  - No more hard coded data, instead defined through config.
    - Extensions, Compats or addition of new Types of Smokables/Suckables is much easier. Ether through integration in the main mod or by making an extension mod with this mod as a dependency.

- Every fix that came with the [Immersion Cig - Hotfix](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3146026772)
  - When taking a new Cigarette from the box, it will try to put the cig first in the goggles/face slot, ifn't, then the NVG slot and only as a last resort, it will put it in the inventory.
  - Allows to light someone else's cig when its in the NVG slot.
  - Rewrote all functions within the modified addon to avoid scheduled environment.(CBA Dependency).
  - Matches, Lighter, Box of Cigarettes are now found in the Misc. Section of the ACE Arsenal

- Integrated Compatibility for KJW's Imposter Mod

### The following Mods are merged into this Rewrite:
- [Kneely's WW2 Cigarettes](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3174419638)
- [Vespade's Immersion Crayons](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2311516767) 
  - Implemented as Suckables, like the lollipops.
  - might maybe come as smokables later.

### The following CDLC's are supported
- S.O.G. Prairie Fire
  - Supports the DLC's Cigarette Pack
  - Supports the DLC's Lighter while retaining its vanilla feature of setting things on fire.
  - Added Smokable Cigarettes that can be taken from the Vanilla Cigarette Pack

### The Following CDLC's might be supported in the future
- Spearhead 1944
  - Since this DLC only provides Facewear Cigarettes, I have find a suitable integration method.
